## rough draft
- Ian Jarvis is a artist, researcher, & educator who dabbles with theory. In general his work engages the implications of the human-technological relationships as digital technology is increasingly becoming engrained as a direct modality of engagement. 
- Artistically his practices spans music creation/performance, computational arts and creativity, and new media art...

## past..
- I have always been facinated by the perceived tension between the arts and sciences
- The beginning of my academic carreer was in physics at SFU. At SFU I took an elective that was open to all students - music composition. In this class I was exposed to technological approaches to music composition or electroacoustic composition. Immediately I was captivated by the creative potential of the computer for creating and producing music, and how it augmented the landscape of musical engagement. At this time (early 2000's) laptops were not ubiquitous and I would get my first laptop in 2003/4?. This changed everything as I became obsessed with making music and how the computer changed the compositional landscape.

- orbit statement: Ian Jarvis is a sound artist, composer, songwriter and media producer from Toronto. Much of his work combines elements of acousmatic art, soundscape composition, algorithmic art and popular music, and is influenced by the implications of technology on creative practices and on the development of personal identities. Recent works are included on the NAISA Deep Wireless 8 CD, the Cybernetic Orchestra’s debut CD ESP.beat and have been presented at the Hamilton Art Crawl, the Sheridan Gallery and the 2012 Toronto Electroacoustic Symposium. He creates “The Becoming of an Audiophile” for NAISA webcast, and composes and produces various audio projects under the names Audio Being and frAncIs.
