## past..
- I have always been facinated by the perceived tension between the arts and sciences
- The beginning of my academic carreer was in physics at SFU. At SFU I took an elective that was open to all students - music composition. In this class I was exposed to technological approaches to music composition or electroacoustic composition. Immediately I was captivated by the creative potential of the computer for creating and producing music, and how it augmented the landscape of musical engagement. At this time (early 2000's) laptops were not ubiquitous and I would get my first laptop in 2003/4?. This changed everything as I became obsessed with making music and how the computer changed the compositional landscape. 
- SFU ea-composition (sound based - 'current name?'). I prefer electro-acooustic as it describes the technological underpinnings of the practice. While computer music perhaps works as a general category, I have tended towards the 
- SFU - ea-composition and how the technology (recent), in particular the computer changes the musical landscape
- McMaster - programming as interface to musical expression (ea-comp as performance) through live coding 
    - scalable laptop performance (solo - CAN, ensemble - LAN, distributed - WAN) that combined live coding with tangible interfaces (physical computing)
